                    Colin Morris recently explored the difficulties of spelling by identifying 
                    Reddit comments with (sp?) next to words. It’s no surprise that Jake Gyllenhaal,
                    along with other celebrities, were atop the list. Let’s take this idea one step further.

                    This chart shows over 600k attempts of people trying to search for Britney Spears. Here
                    are the 8 most common permutations of her first name, Britney. People nail the first three
                    letters—then things get interesting.

                    Britney Spears search data is from Google searches circa 2011. A slightly modified scale was used 
                    to represent the flow diagrams to make all branches’ text legible, so the sizes don’t perfectly 
                    represent the proportion of responses. We chose to only show the top 8 permutations of each name. 
                    Phonetic data is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet via Wikipedia. You can download the 
                    data yourself here.
